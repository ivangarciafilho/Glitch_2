# AutoAssemblyDefinitionManager

AutoAssemblyDefinitionManager makes the time consuming process of manually creating and referencing assembly definiton files into a one-click solution

 - After you press a button your project recompile, you have to restart Unity(this is required because assemblies are never unloaded) and you are done
 - You can revert any time by a single button press as well
 - Your manually created asmdef files will be intact
 - Interaface which lets you easily exclude folders(via text for programmers and or via a packageimport-like interface with checkboxes)
